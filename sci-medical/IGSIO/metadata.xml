    The IGSIO library provides a lightweight, cross-platform C++ library for parsing and serializing OpenIGTLink messages. OpenIGTLink is an open source network communication protocol for image-guided therapy applications, allowing real-time exchange of imaging, tracking, and other patient data between devices and software systems.

    The IGSIO library supports the parsing and serializing of all message types defined in the OpenIGTLink protocol specification, including image messages, transform messages, status messages, and more. It also includes a number of utility classes and functions for working with OpenIGTLink messages, such as IgsioXmlString and IgsioTransformName.

    This library is intended for developers who are building image-guided therapy applications that require real-time exchange of data between devices and software systems using the OpenIGTLink protocol. It is compatible with a wide range of platforms and operating systems, and can be used with both C++ and Python programming languages.
