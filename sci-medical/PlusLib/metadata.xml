 PlusLib is an open-source C++ library for image-guided therapy research and development. It provides a modular and extensible framework for rapid prototyping of image-guided therapy software and applications.

    PlusLib includes a variety of modules for image acquisition, processing, visualization, and interaction, as well as modules for interfacing with various imaging devices and software systems. It also includes a set of command-line tools and GUI applications for testing and demonstrating the functionality of the library.

    The library is designed to be easy to use and easy to extend, with a consistent and well-documented API that allows developers to focus on their research and application development without getting bogged down in low-level details.

    This library is intended for researchers and developers who are working on image-guided therapy applications, such as surgical navigation, biopsy guidance, or radiation therapy planning. It is compatible with a wide range of platforms and operating systems, and can be used with both C++ and Python programming languages.
